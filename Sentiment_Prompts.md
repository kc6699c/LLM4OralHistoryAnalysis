### Background of Japanese American Incarceration
The history of Japanese Americans began with the arrival of the Issei, or “first generation,” who came to the United States as early as 1869. This initial group included laborers who worked in Hawaii's sugarcane fields and California's farms. By the early 20th century, Japanese immigration had significantly increased, with the 1900 U.S. Census recording 24,326 Japanese residents in America, mostly men. Despite restrictive measures like the 1907 Gentlemen's Agreement and the 1913 California Alien Land Law, designed to limit Japanese immigration and prevent land ownership, the community continued to grow. The 1924 Immigration Act further restricted Japanese immigration until 1952, but by then, Japanese Americans had established vibrant communities. They developed businesses, religious institutions, and successful agricultural enterprises, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley. Kenjinkai, regional affinity clubs, offered mutual support and fostered community connections, while the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), formed around 1930, played a crucial role in civil rights and addressing tensions between Issei and U.S.-born Japanese Americans. Both organizations have been vital in preserving Japanese American culture and advocating for their rights. 
During this time, on December 7th, 1941, one big news came out that the Japanese Army attacked Pearl Harbor. This unexpected assault not only marked America's entry into World War II but also triggered a wave of suspicion and hostility towards Japanese Americans. In the immediate aftermath, Japanese Americans faced severe repercussions. In Hawaii, where many of the casualties were Japanese American civilians, authorities swiftly detained community leaders and suspected individuals without formal charges. This led to widespread fear and disruption, with martial law imposed for nearly three years.
On the mainland, the consequences were more gradual but no less intense. Within months of the attack, Executive Order 9066 was signed, leading to the mass removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans. The number of those affected is often cited as between 110,000 and 120,000, depending on the context. The 110,000 figure refers to those forcibly removed from the West Coast, while the 120,000 figure includes those held in camps at various times, including those transferred from other detention systems and new arrivals from Hawaii. Additionally, some estimates suggest that the true number of incarcerated Japanese Americans might be slightly higher when including those in assembly centers and other detention facilities not covered by the War Relocation Authority's records.
