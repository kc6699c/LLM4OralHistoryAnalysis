,KA-009-11,"And then later on, I got an office job working in the clothing allowance whilI was still in camp, where we used to figure out how much each family would be entitled, according to age and the children and everything, but it was a good experience; I enjoyed it.",positive,1,2

,KA-010-9,"But my parents always had a garden. My mother was a real good gardener, and so we never lacked for food after returning from the camp.",positive,1,4
,KA-010-10,"And I think some of the Japanese merchants used to come to Renton Highlands to take orders for Japanese food: Furuya, Asia, and Tsutakawa or something, so we never suffered with hunger after returning from the camp. ",positive,1,4

,AA-015-5,"It's possible that some of the individuals who owed money to my parents' store could have reported my father to the FBI, especially if they felt pressured by the debt collection efforts and wanted to deflect or create problems for my family. In times of heightened tensions and suspicions, especially involving communities under scrutiny like the Japanese during that period, such actions wouldn't be unprecedented.

,AA-017-3,"I recall the long lines going into the mess hall during our time at the internment camp; the food wasn't always bad, and in the evenings, there were dances that lightened the mood. I was housed in Area D, near the fairgrounds, next to a funhouse; we would climb onto its roof, pry open a window to sneak inside, and have a good time rolling around in the barrels.",positive,1,2
,AA-017-4,"We had a lookout who would signal us when soldiers approached, allowing us to scramble out of the funhouse we snuck into; once the soldiers left, we would sneak back in. During this time, I didn't have many friends, so I mostly spent time with a couple of Eurasian kids, including my cousin, who was also Eurasian due to my uncle Hiromu's marriage to a Caucasian woman. Eventually, these Eurasian children were released before the rest of us were moved to Minidoka.",neutral,0,2

,AA-018-6,"Gee, when I got to Minidoka, I looked out and I saw that desolate, desolate place on the side tracks of Eden, I couldn't believe what, where we were at, and the buses came and hauled us in, and the camp was not completed, it was still in the construction stages, and Block 1 was completed, that's where the original volunteer advance crew was, living, and then Block 3, I was assigned to Block 3, which had just been completed, and there was dust and it was ankle-deep all over, it was... and the wind was blowing and it was hot, no shade.",negative,-1,2

I believe I was in Los Angeles for VJ Day because I vividly remember the day, unlike many who may not recognize the term. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki felt remote to me at the time, though I've since met people affected by it, including a woman from the Venice Japanese Community Center who was trapped for three days after the bombing and knew many who died.

There was also a canteen in the camp where we received some sort of clothing allowance, and it was common to recognize clothing items others wore that had been ordered from catalogs like Montgomery Ward or Sears Roebuck. This was a new experience for me since, in Los Angeles, we always shopped directly in stores, so I had never known what a catalog was before camp. Regarding ordering from these catalogs, I mostly ordered clothing, as there wasn't a store in the camp that sold clothes—mostly just small items like candy bars.",neutral,0,2

We also had daily chores like fetching charcoal, and due to the lack of proper paths and lighting, moving around at night, especially to the bathroom, was challenging. We didn't have the comforts like sidewalks, and when it rained, the conditions worsened.

There, I learned about ""comfort zones"" set up with professional women to keep the soldiers entertained and away from civilians.

,DB-002-1,"I'm going to guess there were about sixty orphans there, ranging from very small children to high school age. As I recall, when they reached the age of eighteen, which was considered young adulthood, they would leave the camp to live elsewhere because at that age, the government or the orphanage no longer had responsibility for them.",neutral,0,2
,DB-002-2,"When I first arrived, our barracks were already prepared for us. We had nice facilities, which I think were a bit better built than the regular barracks because they were specifically constructed for the orphanage. From what I recall, there were large dormitories. Speaking just for the boys' side, where I stayed, it was structured for different age groups—kindergarten through fifth grade in one wing, and maybe sixth grade through high school in another. The younger kids were on one side, the older kids on the other, and the counselors' quarters were in between. We were very fortunate to have a wonderful counselor named John Nagayama who guided us and provided assistance as we grew up.",positive,1,2
,DB-004-1,"One of my worst memories is the stark realization that we were prisoners. Every night, searchlights would circle around the camp and flash through the windows of the barracks, a constant reminder of our confinement. The presence of the barbed wire fence physically trapping us in was deeply distressing. The fact that we were prisoners is undoubtedly the worst memory for me. Additionally, there was a riot at one point, and I heard that some people were shot; I've read since then that this is true. On a somewhat brighter note, the soldiers, although they had to do their job, were somewhat lenient with us kids. They weren't mean; they would chat with us when we walked by the towers. This interaction with some of the soldiers is a better memory, reflecting more on the individuals than the system itself.",negative,-1,2
,DB-004-2,"When I was about to leave the camp to go live with the Bambauers, who would ultimately adopt me, I was told I had to stop by the military compound to be fingerprinted. I was only six or seven years old, and I remember the soldier telling me this was in case I did anything bad in the future; they'd be able to catch me. That moment was traumatic for me. Although I'm sure the soldier didn't mean to scare me, it really knocked me for a loop. It made me very sad and scared rather than angry, as at that age, you don't get angry, you get scared. I didn't know where I was going, and I knew nothing about the Bambauers except that they had come to the camp wanting to adopt a child and had chosen me. Leaving my friends and the only comfort I knew, combined with this frightening experience, was deeply traumatic, and it’s something I've never been able to fully overcome.",negative,-1,2
,DB-004-3,"I actually have no idea what the specific regulations were that allowed me to leave the camp because I was being adopted by a Caucasian family. Reflecting on the fingerprinting episode, I was also given a green card during that process. The same person who fingerprinted me—warning that they would catch me if I ever behaved badly—told me that I had to wear that card around my neck because I was being allowed to leave the camp. I think the general rule was that you had to have the card in your possession, but for a six-year-old, they said it should be around your neck. Being told I could never go without it, especially after being fingerprinted, just compounded the fear even more.",negative,-1,2
,DB-004-4,"So I don't know what the regulation was that allowed me to get out. When I got out, I got to have the privilege of the racial taunts because I was in third grade, and I was known as the ""yellow Jap"" by other students. And I understand how immigrants feel who have to go through this similar type thing.",negative,-1,2
,DB-005-1,"The weather and winds at Manzanar were just hideous. It was extremely hot in the summer and bone-chilling in the winter, but the constant was always the wind. It didn’t matter if it was blowing cold air or hot air; it often carried dust and fine sand with it. This dust would get into your eyes and ears, making it truly miserable. It was always blowing, always making life more difficult there.",negative,-1,2
,DB-006-1,"Well, I don't think I lost anything by being placed in the camp; rather, I think I gained some appreciation for a culture that I might not have ever enjoyed had I not been there. Since leaving the camp, I've been able to reconnect with friends from the orphanage, which was a positive outcome from my experience. It's a unique perspective because I was the only one from my background in that situation. ",positive,1,5
,DB-006-2,"I don't believe that my friends or family members who were at Heart Mountain needed or benefitted from that experience like I did. So, in a way, I might be the only one who can say it was beneficial because it created lifelong friendships. However, it was still terribly wrong. Today, I think it's crucial for Americans to remain vigilant to preserve individual rights, especially in the face of terrorism. I worry about repeating the same mistakes with current groups as were made with my family and friends back then. That's a concern of mine.",negative,-1,5
,DB-006-3,"Well, I'm probably somewhat cynical, but when you believe you're right, it doesn't matter how many facts you're presented, you still think you're right.

But one nice thing about America is that we do have a judicial system that works, which helps restore rights and administers punishment when it's appropriate.",positive,1,5

I wasn't personally involved in the activism because I lived far from my Japanese friends and grew up in a small town where I was the only Japanese resident. However, I supported the Japanese Citizens League as a member and backed their activities financially. The activism was driven by a few key individuals, though I'm a bit uncertain about the specifics.",neutral,0,5
,DB-006-6,"I didn't find the presidential letter of apology personally meaningful; I felt it was long overdue and came too late. While I did receive a check, it didn't matter much to me.

Nikki Bridges,NB-001-1,"The men in the camps, especially the older ones who didn’t have jobs, came up with the idea to make carp ponds. They swiped cement from construction sites, dug out spaces between the barracks, and made these ponds. Then they fetched carp from the Colorado River to put in them. Sadly, the cement seeped into the water and killed all the fish. Seeing them float belly up was grim, and it made me think of our own situation in a dark way.",negative,-1,2
,NB-001-2,"We tried to lift our spirits, though. We jitterbugged and danced in the mess halls, all decked out with crepe paper. I remember when Frank Sinatra's song ""This Love of Mine"" was a hit—though none of us could really do it justice. We also had talent shows in the camp. Most of the performers were pretty awful, but now and then, a kid would steal the show, like my cousin Emiko Omori's ten-year-old cousin who nailed ""Chattanooga Choo Choo."" He became everyone’s favorite.",positive,1,2
,NB-001-3,"There were also these small trees by the administration buildings in the camp. One day, someone decorated them with crepe paper flowers, making it look like spring had come. No one ever found out who did it, but it was a beautiful gesture. And there was this one bachelor who died shortly after we arrived. The women stayed up all night making crepe paper flowers for his wreath. I think he got more attention in death than he ever did in life",positive,1,2
,NB-002-1,"When we first... well, Pearl Harbor was sort of the beginning. But even before that, there were signs, such as the Issei being forced to register under the Alien Registration Act. I had to take my parents to the post office to have their pictures taken and register their thumbprints.",neutral,0,1
,NB-002-2,"When the war started, we listened to all the same radio programs, but had to get rid of the shortwave immediately. Walter Winchell, in particular, spent a lot of time denigrating us, making us out to be spies and traitors. He was one of the foremost media figures urging the government to evacuate us, claiming we were dangerous and would poison the water supply or signal submarines offshore because many of our farms were on the coast. This made my parents increasingly anxious, and they didn’t want to plant for the next year. However, an agricultural man came by and told us we had to plant, and then asked what we were doing with our tools, farm equipment, and horse. We tried to carry on, but it was obvious we were going to be sent away. My father had a truck that we abandoned and we sold all our tools and the toolshed for fifteen dollars. We also had a '39 Plymouth that we sold for two hundred dollars, with the condition that the buyer would drive us to the high school where we were supposed to congregate.",negative,-1,2
,NB-003-1,"There wasn't more dissension or refusal to go to the camps for several reasons. Firstly, the median age of the Nisei, who were citizens, was only nineteen, making them young and inexperienced. The community leaders were Issei, who were around forty-five and had no power or influence. Additionally, within the first week, the FBI had already rounded up anyone with any standing in the community who might have been a leader. The Nisei were also pretty well brainwashed into wanting to do what the hakujin (white people) wanted them to do, which was to be docile and accepting of whatever the decree was.",negative,-1,2
,NB-003-2," think it took so long for the Nisei to articulate their shame because we were young at the time, with a median age of nineteen, an age when we should have been establishing our identities and self-worth. Instead, our country, which we loved, banished us and labeled us as suspects and traitors. This emotional rejection had a profound impact on us. For a long time, I refused to acknowledge it as a significant moment in my life, only realizing its impact about thirty years later. In my fifties, I was finally able to look back and recognize the emotional trauma, feelings of rejection, and internal family strife it caused. It was only then, having established a sense of security about myself, that I could speak out and address what happened.",negative,-1,2
,NB-003-3,"The initial period of adjustment in the camp was the unhappiest time as the reality of their situation set in. Despite feeling pro-American and identifying as American rather than Japanese, the speaker faced conflict with their parents, who questioned how they could support a country that imprisoned them. This led to emotional distress and frequent crying. Eventually, they established a truce to avoid constant fighting, but the family atmosphere remained tense and unfriendly.",negative,-1,2
,NB-004-1,"Regarding redress, I think it's essential that we all receive a substantial amount of money. I would have preferred more than twenty thousand dollars, and I'm not even sure if that's guaranteed. However, it means a lot to us because we spent nearly three years on average in these concentration camps for something beyond our control—our ancestry linking us to Japan, which was at war with the United States. For the U.S. to treat innocent people this way, selecting us based on our ancestry and imprisoning us in concentration camps, is a terrible chapter in our history as a democratic country. It contradicts the principles of not imprisoning people without due process and not taking away property without due process. Even after forty-some years, it still deeply affects us, and until the matter is resolved, it remains a source of unhappiness.",negative,-1,5
,NB-004-2,"My parents were quite old during the internment; my father was nearly seventy, and my mother nearly sixty. They were independent farmers who leased land and made a living, albeit a sparse one. The concentration camp experience caused them to lose their farming base and their desire to start anew. When they were released, there was no work available for them, and they lacked the capital to restart, having only about three hundred dollars in savings. I moved to San Francisco and started working for the War Relocation Authority, the agency set up to help evacuees, earning $1440 a year. I managed to support us all and continued to support my parents until they died.",negative,-1,5

However, she had my address, but I didn't have hers. I expected to hear from her so I could respond, but I never did. I had afterthoughts, wondering if she left and later thought, ""Yes, I was hurt, yes, I was angry, yes, she was not a good friend."" Those thoughts stayed with me, even though she's gone now.",negative,-1,4
,MA-010-8,"Up until Sachi returned to Seattle and we met face to face, I had harbored anti-Japanese feelings, but they seemed to vanish when she came back. Those feelings had been at their height when I wrote the letter to her, but they started disappearing afterward. I believe these feelings were influenced by powerful, anti-Japanese movies that I couldn't separate from reality. Reflecting on it, being Jewish, I should have realized the importance of not letting such prejudices affect me, given what Jews have gone through.",neutral,0,4
,MA-011-1,"To answer your question about similarities, I cannot compare the Nazis' intent to annihilate all Jews during World War II with the internment of Japanese Americans. The Nazis aimed to wipe out an entire people, which is different in scale and intent. However, the internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans was also a terrible, shameful part of our history. It was wrong, and it's important to acknowledge and remember that.",negative,-1,5

Many students, including me, just continued with our lives.

Sadly, I wasn’t one of those who felt the urge to help at the time.",negative,-1,2

Some students and teachers were more compassionate and took action to help the interned students. Eventually, I developed a stronger sense of empathy and understanding, but during that period at Broadway High, and even later at Garfield High, most of us continued with our lives, selfish as it may sound.",neutral,0,2

Hisako visited me at the flower shop a couple of times after the war, but we eventually lost touch.",neutral,0,4

,GA-002-1,"My father was picked up by the FBI the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, on December 8th, 1941. I believe one reason they took him so quickly was because of his active role in the Japanese community. He wasn't exactly a leader, but he worked as a kind of liaison, helping to bridge the gap between our community and the English-speaking Caucasians. He helped both sides understand what the other was thinking and communicating, translating what our community was discussing so everyone involved was informed. The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) had a list of everyone active like this, and since his last name started with 'A', his name was probably right at the top. That's likely why they came for him so quickly.",negative,-1,2
,GA-002-2,"When I mentioned the JACL compiling lists, I was talking about the names of people who were active in the community during the war. But I imagine they also kept track of pretty much everyone else in the Japanese community, sort of like a directory. It wasn't just a diary or something simple; it was a detailed directory that included who was living in the community, where they lived, and all that sort of thing.",neutral,0,2
,GA-004-1,"My brother Jim was working in the kitchen at the Puyallup Assembly Center, known as ""Camp Harmony,"" and he noticed a problem. While monitoring the food service, he saw that elderly and sick individuals were struggling to get their food because they couldn't easily come to the kitchen themselves. He thought it would be a good idea to set up a tray service to bring food to those who couldn't fetch it themselves. To get this started, he approached the leaders of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) who were overseeing various camp activities. However, they didn't pay any attention to his suggestion. Determined to make a difference, Jim didn’t give up there. He went straight to the head of the assembly center to discuss his idea and seek permission to organize the tray service.",neutral,0,2
,GA-004-2,"Well, I'm not entirely sure why the JACL initially ignored my brother's idea. I guess they might have thought there were other, more pressing issues to handle first—they probably figured they could worry about the tray service later. But for people who are hungry and especially those who are sick or elderly, getting food is immediately important. My brother saw it that way. He recognized that making sure everyone could eat was a priority that needed attention right away, not later. That difference in perspective is likely why there was a bit of a disconnect initially.",neutral,0,2
,GA-004-3,"When my brother decided to bypass the JACL and went directly to the camp administration, it didn't sit well with the JACL. They started seeing him as a troublemaker because he didn't just follow their dictates. As a result, he ended up being more or less blacklisted by them. They weren't pleased that he went over their heads to get something done, even though he was just trying to help those in need.",negative,-1,2
,GA-004-4,"Yes, the camp administration actually thought it was a great idea. So during the time we were interned there, for about five or six months, we set up a tray committee. All the girls would help out, delivering meals and taking back trays for those who were sick, bedridden, or unable to walk. It turned out to be quite successful. Everyone appreciated it, especially the spouses who were relieved to see their loved ones being cared for in such a challenging time.",positive,1,2

For example, he noticed some black marketing activities, like people taking all the sports equipment and either giving it away or selling it, which left the kids in the camp without any equipment for baseball or football. My brother tried to address this by informing the camp administration, but they ignored him. So, he took it upon himself to write a letter to Washington, D.C., explaining the situation—how essentials like food and sports equipment were being mismanaged in the internment camps.",negative,-1,2
,GA-004-6,"His actions led to some officials coming down to investigate, but this didn't sit well with the administration. They didn't appreciate him going over their heads again, and as a result, he became further known as a ""troublemaker"" and was increasingly blacklisted. This label followed him and seemed to cause ongoing issues for him within the camp's administrative and social structures.",negative,-1,2

Unfortunately, this approach led to him being labeled as a ""troublemaker"" by those in power.",negative,-1,2

We were placed on a stop-order list, which meant we couldn’t leave the camp for temporary leaves like other internees might have for shopping trips or work opportunities, such as going to Salt Lake City for sugar beet farming to earn some money. We discovered we were on this list when our applications for such permissions were denied, informing us that we were restricted from leaving.

So, I decided to stand my ground and answered 'no' to the question. I wasn’t going to volunteer for combat duty under those circumstances.",negative,-1,3

However, since I agreed with the first two parts of the question—swearing allegiance to the U.S. and defending it—I ended up answering ""yes"" to the overall question. It was like they were asking three separate things, and I said ""yes"" to two of them but ""no"" to the third, because, frankly, you can't forsake what you never had.",neutral,0,2
,GA-006-1,"I remember that period. The government used the loyalty questionnaire to determine loyalty levels among Japanese Americans, leading to some being moved to Tule Lake, a segregation camp for those deemed less loyal. Around September of 1943, they started transferring people deemed more loyal out of Tule Lake to other camps, including Minidoka. In my block at Minidoka, Block 5, we had about three or four people from Tule Lake join us.",neutral,0,2
,GA-006-2,"there were indeed people at Minidoka who answered ""no"" to both loyalty questions and possibly indicated other things on the questionnaire that suggested they weren't as loyal to the United States. These individuals were often referred to as ""no-nos"" and were moved from Minidoka to Tule Lake. From my experience, the transfer of these individuals was kept quite secretive. One day they were just gone, and it wasn't clear where they had been sent until later, when we learned they were moved to Tule Lake, many because they wanted to repatriate to Japan. As kids, we were mostly oblivious to these movements because we were busy with school and playing sports, so we didn't really notice until after the fact.",neutral,0,2
,GA-007-1,"I remember there were talks about possibly moving to Crystal City. The reason behind this was because it was a family internment camp where we could potentially reunite with our dad, who was at the Santa Fe internment camp at that time. My mom even made an application for us to move there, hoping that it would bring our family back together sooner. However, what we didn't realize at the time was that the government's underlying plan was to use Crystal City as a stepping stone for repatriating families to Japan. They intended to gather families there and then send them back to Japan. Indeed, a number of families from Crystal City were sent to Japan in '43. They didn’t travel directly but took a more circuitous route, stopping at various places before finally arriving in Japan. The details of their journey are complex and involve several stops along the way to their final destination in Japan.",neutral,0,2
,GA-007-2,"Our family assumed that moving to Crystal City meant we could be together and stay there for the duration of the war. We didn't expect to be sent anywhere else. But in reality, we ended up being more like hostages. Just like many Japanese people from Brazil, Chile, and other parts of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. gathered them and us, intending to use us as hostages. The plan was to exchange us for American prisoners of war with Japan. So, while some families might have gone willingly, many were likely sent against their will, used as leverage for these exchanges.",negative,-1,2
,GA-007-3,"Well, it was pretty clear that we were held in Minidoka essentially as hostages. They didn't trust us to go anywhere or relocate.

Until the day the FBI came to pick me up, my parents didn't know what I was going to do. They told me, ""It's up to you. This is your life, your country, so you do what you think is right.""

I hope we never see that kind of thing again, but you never know when people get upset, they do things they don't really mean.
